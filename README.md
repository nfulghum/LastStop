# Last Stop

## Description
Last Stop was created to give a platform to the outdoor enthusiast where they can buy, sell, trade, and connect with like minded people. This is a social platform as well as a e-commerce experience. The project remains incomplete as it is a passion project that will continue to grow as I continue to learn new technologies. Keep an eye out for updates in the future!

## API and Tech Stack
MapQuest [API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/static-map-api/v5/) Static Map was used to create a map based off the address entered for the Meet up location.

The tech stack is a Python backend using Flask, with server rendered Jinja pages. All of the Javascript/CSS is from a purchased template used to enhance the aesthetic of the page. The HTML pages are also from this template but have been modified by myself using Jinja. All template pages were purchased from [Canvas](<https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123>) on [themeforest](<https://themeforest.net/>)

## Features
- Add gear to buy, sell, or trade. (all transactions happen off the site via email)

## User Flow    
The basic flow will be a user will register/log in to an account (or proceed through certain parts of app w/ out credentials). Once logged in the user is able to post gear/events on the site that other users/non-users can see and interact with as well. This will allow the user to sell, buy, trade gear or sign up for an event.

At the top of each page the user will have the ability to easily move through the application via the header options. User can access there profile where any events and gear they have posted will be accessed and can be deleted. Users can also edit there profile information here.
