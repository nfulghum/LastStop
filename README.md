# Last Stop

## Description
Last Stop was created to give a platform to the outdoor enthusiast where they can buy, sell, trade, and connect with like minded people. This is a social platform as well as a e-commerce experience. The project remains incomplete as it is a passion project that will continue to grow as I continue to learn new technologies. Keep an eye out for updates in the future!
